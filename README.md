# DSP-Design
This repository contains algorithms from a digital signal processing (DSP) design course, along with the development from theory for each of them. The theory assumes the reader has already taken a course in linear systems and signals and is familiar with the introductory topics of DSP, including block-by-block processing. Reading them in order will provide an introduction to sample-by-sample processing, optimization using circular delay line buffers, and fast block-by-block processing methods and applications. Of course, if you just want the programs, feel free to use them. Each folder contains all program files, a .pdf called "Description and Theory", and a .zip file for easy download of all files. Some programs are taught in clusters. They've been broken down into individual programs in separate repositories.
